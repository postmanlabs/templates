# Postman Classroom Teaching Kit

_This kit is for educators looking to teach Postman in their programs._

Thanks for your interest in teaching Postman in your classroom! 🎓🎒🚀

Here you will find supporting resources you can use to build Postman into your learning experiences. You are welcome to use these resources as they are or to fork and remix them.

## Postman Classroom Template

The Postman Classroom template walks learners through API and Postman fundamentals. Learners can import the template, send the first request, and be guided through next steps by the response data via the Postman visualizer.

The template is available at a short url:

* [bit.ly/postman-classroom](http://bit.ly/postman-classroom)

_If you plan on using the template in your classroom please try it out in Postman yourself first. Open the first request, send it, and open the Visualize view on the response. The instructions guide you through the steps–but you are also welcome to add your own context or any additional info you feel learners will benefit from._

Please check out the [Postman classroom curriculum](student.md) for pointers on topics. The list is generic but you are welcome to choose topics to suit your own programs and learning contexts. If you'd like to make suggestions on the curriculum or classroom experience [please submit an issue](https://github.com/postmanlabs/templates/issues)!

## Postman Classroom Slides

The slide deck is available at a short url—it's in Google Slides but you can download and edit it however you like.
